== FileStorage

A rails plugin similar to acts_as_attachment/paperclip, but different.  We don't attach files to things.  Files ARE the things.  So you say your model has_file_storage and it will respond to things like file_name and data. (But in actual implementation these are stored in a separate table)

Also, we support MogileFS, so there's that.
